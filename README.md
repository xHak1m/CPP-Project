## üöÄ Project Collection

These projects demonstrate beginner to intermediate C++ concepts, including:

- ‚úÖ Object-Oriented Programming
- ‚úÖ Templates
- ‚úÖ Data Structures (`vector`, `map`)
- ‚úÖ File I/O
- ‚úÖ Dynamic Memory
- ‚úÖ Mini Game Logic

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- C++17
- Standard Template Library (STL)
- File Handling (some projects)
- OOP / Class-based Design

---

## üéØ Why This Repo?

Unlike most academic exercises, these programs:

- Emphasize real-world problem solving
- Use STL and templates where appropriate
- Are clean, modular, and production-ready
- Can be extended to more complex systems (e.g., file storage, authentication)

--

## üìå Notes

- All files are compiled and tested.

- Projects are designed for learning and can be extended further.
